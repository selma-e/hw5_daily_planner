# Selma's HW5 Daily Planner

## Description:

In this activity, I am building a daily planner that utilizes localhost to store daily tasks. In conjunction with Moment JS, I am able to translate times and dates to display the planner with past, present, and future colors (past= grey, present = red, future = green). This is a very handy real world planner I could use on a daily basis. I also did some research on how to translate military time to 12 hour time and vice versa.
